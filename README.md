# Hackathon-Public-Sentiment-on-the-New-Distance-Based-Fare-System
Hi 
This project was built for a data science hackathon to analyze how people feel about Rwanda’s shift to a distance-based public transport fare system.

While the new fare model is meant to be fairer, it has sparked mixed reactions online. So, I created a mock dataset that simulates these public opinions — and used it to build a sentiment analysis pipeline from scratch.

🔍 What I Did

Cleaned and preprocessed text data
Vectorized the text using TF-IDF
Labeled sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral
Trained models like KNN, SVC, and Random Forest
Tuned model parameters with GridSearchCV
Evaluated performance with classification metrics
Analyzed sentiment trends over the years

📈The goal 

The goal is to help policymakers see how people feel, track how sentiment has changed over time, and make better decisions based on that insight.

🛠️ How to Use

Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
Run each section — it’s organized clearly like a book
Check out the model results and the trend graph
This project is a prototype, but the same process can be applied to real tweets, forum posts, or survey data. Thanks for reading!
